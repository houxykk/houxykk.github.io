I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science at Yonsei University with a strong interest in research and innovation. I aspire to explore the intersection of computer science and game design, particularly in system logic and algorithm analysis, combining technical depth with creative thinking. I value the ability to conduct independent research and to learn new technologies quickly. To me, research is not merely about solving problems, but about continuously creating and discovering new possibilities.
